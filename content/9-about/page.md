## About the Medical Clinic

Boniface & Paulina Okafor Memorial Clinic (B&P.O) is located at Umudim Ngodo Isuochi of Abia State, Nigeria. Most inhabitants of this village are poor farmers and petty traders, who have no healthcare insurance and access to basic amenities of life like hospital, water and electricity. Medical care and treatments are solely the responsibility of the patient or his/her family. One has to pay upfront for medical consultation and any drugs or treatment received.

Lack of money may lead to possible death unless God in his infinite mercy grants healing to the sick person.

Most people who don’t have money pray and look up to God for healing. This has led to the proliferation of spiritual healing centers, native/traditional healing shrines or patent medicine stores. As a consequence, there are often many deaths and health complications. It’s sad to see common tropical diseases like malaria killing so many children, young people and adults. Also many die of some diseases that are curable, preventable or controllable such as high blood pressure or diabetes.

Due to lack of proper health care and proximity to a hospital, many young women have died during childbirth and some have complications for lack of proper prenatal care and basic education. This project is to help provide subsidized healthcare services to the poor and needy in that area. It helps bring a clinic/hospital closer to the people; provide free consultation with a medical doctor and subsidized drugs, and in some cases free medication.
